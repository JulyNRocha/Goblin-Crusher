## Description
In this **Tower Defence  game** your objective is defend the kingdom against the horrible order of goblins by placing towers and not spending all the kingdom's money.

## Project 

This was a project that a did in Unity using basic knowledge, studying more complex aspects of C# scripts as:

- Work with instanciantion with Input
- Work with Objetc Pools (Actication and Desactivation of entities)
- Work with Tiles and Coordinates
- Work with PathFinding and *[Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)*
- Working with Dictionares and Broadcast Message
- Script Execution Order
- And Finaly Working with Pure C# scripts in Unity

## The Course 

I made this Game following the [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) course from [GameDevTv](https://github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper2) but I didnâ€™t do exactly as in the course, I didn't use their 3d assets and I didn't use post Render because my main focus its learn how to code with unit.

The experience was wonderful. I had a problem that was not involved with the course because the assets that I got from the asset store come with Animation and I haven't learned to work with them yet, but I can't wait to see what else I gonna learn.
